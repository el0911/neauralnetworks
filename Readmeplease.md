this is a set of helpfull neaural net codes written by me from countless hours of study and tutorials , i would try and make the code as flexible as possible to make sure this can be appleid in various applications ...........tank you





1) Singlenode this is a single layer network no hidden layer

2)SinglenodeGNN is a single layer network that trains with genetic algorithm instead of back propagation

3)multilayerNN a multy layer network with hidden layers

4)multilayerGNN a multy layer network trained with the genetic algorithm note this is slow and needs alot of  power to train i recommendnd it over NN if you have like few days to train it has the potential to be much better than the simple back propagation calculations

just that u probably need like say  a million iniial population and like 300 generations 

Yeah if u are working on Quantom computing hurry up and finish so i can train models like this withouth spending 6 years
